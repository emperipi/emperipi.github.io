I study how cells, from bacteria and algae to mammalian eukaryotic cells, move and how their environments shape and guide that motion. My goal is to uncover the physical principles that govern the interplay between motility, migration, and complex environments, with implications for development, immune response, bacterial infection, and cancer invasion.

My research combines theoretical modeling, data-driven analysis, and quantitative approaches to address questions such as:

- **How do microorganisms adapt their motility strategies to navigate through obstacles and confined spaces?**
- **In what ways do physical environments influence microbial search efficiency and infection potential?**
- **How do cells process noisy and fluctuating signals to achieve robust sensing and coordination?**
- **What roles do emergent behaviors—such as memory effects and collective exploration—play in cellular adaptation?**

By revealing how physical constraints and environmental cues shape the movement and sensory capabilities of living systems, this research provides insights relevant to infection dynamics, tissue organization, and biomaterial design. The goal is to advance understanding of the diverse and fascinating strategies microorganisms use to sense and respond to the world around them.
