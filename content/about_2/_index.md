I’m a scientist driven by curiosity and a fascination with how living systems work. Over the years, I’ve enjoyed moving between disciplines—physics, biology, and data science—chasing interesting problems and working with great people. My research has taken me from studying how cells move and communicate, to developing models that help us make sense of complex experimental data, and even to building tools for detecting odd behaviors in massive industrial datasets.

I like finding patterns in noisy data, asking questions that cut across fields, and collaborating with researchers from different backgrounds. I’m comfortable diving into new topics, learning new techniques, and explaining tricky ideas in a way that makes sense to others. Along the way, I’ve mentored students, published in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at international conferences—experiences I value not just for the science, but for the teamwork and shared learning.

I am interested in the diffusion and motility of microorganisms, such as bacteria and cells, the interaction with their habitats, the propagation of information inside biological systems, and the robustness of signal processing under fluctuating environments. 

In my research, I aim to explain experimental observations with simple theoretical models that allow me to identify the fundamental elements underlying these biological processes. To do so, I combine tools from statistical physics, stochastic processes, and active matter physics together with detailed data analysis methods.
