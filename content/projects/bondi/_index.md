During my doctoral years at the University of Buenos Aires, I took the 160 bus every day to get to the office. I spent countless hours at bus stops, witnessing a maddening yet intriguing pattern: I’d wait 20, sometimes 30 minutes without a single bus, and then—suddenly—three would arrive together.

At first, I blamed the drivers, the bus company, or the traffic. What were they doing—waiting to travel together and chat at red lights? Was I just unlucky? It didn’t add up. The more I thought about it, the more I realized it wasn’t random at all, but inevitable. Bus bunching isn’t a failure of planning; it’s the outcome of physics and feedback loops. 

## A positive feedback loop
Imagine Bus A hits traffic or finds more passengers than usual at a stop. It falls slightly behind schedule. Now the next stop has had more time to accumulate passengers, so Bus A takes even longer to board them. It falls further behind. Meanwhile, Bus B behind it finds fewer passengers at each stop—it speeds up and catches Bus A.

Traffic, weather, accidents—any event that delays a bus will push it toward this outcome. The gaps between buses don't correct themselves; they grow.

This is a positive feedback loop. Evenly-spaced buses are an unstable equilibrium. Bus bunching is the stable one. Left alone, bunching is where all buses end up.

So why don't we see it all the time?

Bus bunching makes service unpredictable: passengers face long waits followed by multiple buses at once, some packed and others nearly empty. It also wastes resources—several large buses traveling together clog traffic while leaving gaps in service elsewhere. The problem gets worse with longer routes, higher frequency, more passengers, unpredictable traffic, and slow boarding—all of which give the feedback loop more room to grow. Transit agencies fight back by holding early buses at stops, padding schedules with extra recovery time, using GPS to adjust speeds in real time, and reducing boarding variability with prepaid fares and multiple doors. Dedicated bus lanes help by removing traffic randomness. None of these eliminate bunching, but they slow it down.
