The physical and chemical characteristics of the cellular environment critically shape how cells move, organize, and interact. Environmental factors—including mechanical confinement, substrate composition, and chemical gradients—not only influence single-cell motility but also coordinate complex collective behaviors during development, tissue repair, and disease progression. Understanding how environmental conditions modulate cell migration provides key insights into diverse biological processes such as embryogenesis, immune surveillance, and cancer metastasis.

### Eukaryotic Cell Migration in Confined Channels

Using microfluidic channels to model cancer cell invasion, our research shows that physical confinement strongly influences both collective migration and cell dissociation—or "rupture." Within these constrained environments, cells detach from invasive strands, a process central to metastatic dissemination. Most rupture events involve single cells breaking away, though larger multicellular clusters (up to ~20 cells) can also detach in wider channels.

Detachment propensity is not uniform among all cells. Highly motile "leader cells," found at the migrating front, are especially prone to dissociation and largely account for the predominance of single-cell ruptures. These leader cells typically exhibit greater self-propulsion and reduced contact with surrounding neighbors, contributing to their likelihood of breaking off.

Adhesive interactions and chemotactic signaling play key roles in regulating rupture dynamics. Cell–wall adhesion is essential for both invasion into narrow channels and the occurrence of ruptures, but excessive adhesion can inhibit detachment. Stronger cell–cell adhesion generally leads to fewer but larger rupture events. Notably, mathematical modeling indicates that effective cell–cell adhesion may decrease dynamically in narrow confinements, potentially explaining why rupture rates remain similar across different channel widths. Enhanced chemotactic gradients synchronize cell movement, resulting in larger and more rapid ruptures.

At the molecular level, confinement-induced dissociation is driven by activation of the RhoA/ROCK/Myosin IIA pathway and changes in microtubule dynamics. RhoA activation, mediated by GEF-H1, Ect2, and RacGAP1, promotes myosin II accumulation at junctions, generating contractile forces that disrupt cell–cell adhesions.

Importantly, while unjamming (fluidization) of the tissue is a prerequisite for cell dissociation, it alone does not suffice to trigger rupture. Tissues may attain a fluid-like state without necessarily undergoing dissociation, indicating that factors beyond general tissue fluidity are necessary for rupture to occur.

In summary, cell migration and dissociation within confined environments reflect a complex interplay between physical constraints, cellular properties, and molecular signaling pathways—mechanisms with direct relevance to our understanding of cancer metastasis and related collective behaviors.
