## Do cells modify their environment as they move?  

Cells do not migrate in a passive landscape: as they move, they alter their surroundings, leaving long-lived *footprints* that can strongly influence their future motion. A central goal of my research is to understand how these feedbacks between cell motility and the environment generate new migration strategies in both single cells and collectives.

### Footprints and migration strategies  

Through theoretical modeling and analysis of experiments, I have shown that the impact of footprints depends strongly on geometry. On linear tracks, cells often confine themselves to oscillatory motion, while on two-dimensional substrates they display more exploratory dynamics. Small changes in deposition or sensing of footprints can switch cells between confined, oscillatory, and persistent migration modes (PNAS 2024). These results reveal how even identical cells can adopt fundamentally different strategies simply by varying their interaction with footprints and the substrate.

### Collective effects and guidance efficiency  

Footprints also serve as local guidance cues for other cells, enabling leader–follower coordination during collective migration. I study how footprint persistence, density, and degradation shape the efficiency of such guidance, and under which conditions footprints enhance cooperative migration or instead generate crowding and jamming effects. More broadly, I am developing models to assess how footprints affect navigation efficiency, by comparing target search times with and without footprint cues in noisy or degrading environments.

### Detecting the signatures of footprint interactions  

Because footprints are often invisible, their role must be inferred from cell trajectories. I identify their signatures through statistical properties such as revisits, velocity correlations, and aging in mean squared displacement. By fitting motility models with Bayesian inference, I extract quantitative parameters like confinement strength and memory timescales. This approach provides a way to reveal and measure footprint interactions even when they cannot be directly observed.
