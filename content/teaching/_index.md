I am deeply committed to making physics and interdisciplinary science accessible, engaging, and relevant for students from diverse backgrounds. My teaching experience spans undergraduate and graduate courses in physics—including mechanics, thermodynamics, and optics—as well as interdisciplinary classes in biophysics and statistical mechanics. I have taught at institutions such as **Universidad Católica Argentina**, **Universidad de Buenos Aires**, and **Johns Hopkins University**, where I have lectured, led laboratory courses, developed curriculum materials, and mentored students through research-intensive programs.

### Teaching Philosophy

My approach to teaching is driven by clarity, engagement, and responsiveness. I design courses to foster a deep understanding of fundamental concepts and to encourage active learning through exercises, group activities, and hands-on assignments. I frequently incorporate computational tools—including coding and simulations—so that students can visualize models, test their own ideas, and develop broadly applicable scientific skills.

I strive to cultivate an inclusive and welcoming classroom environment where students from all backgrounds feel supported and are encouraged to contribute. I am dedicated to adopting active learning techniques, diverse assessment methods, and inclusive strategies, continually seeking feedback and growth opportunities to enhance the learning experience.

### Mentoring

Mentoring is an essential aspect of my role as an educator and researcher. I believe effective mentorship creates a collaborative environment in which knowledge and inspiration flow both ways, enriching both students and mentors. I have guided students in their development of modeling, data analysis, and scientific literature engagement through programs such as the WISE program, the Ingenuity Project, and international research exchanges. My goal as a mentor is to attract new minds to science and help foster diversity and innovation within the scientific community.
