Understanding how cells integrate and prioritize these competing cues, deciding when to follow local versus distant signals, is critical for biological processes such as immune responses and tissue repair. Experimental observations reveal diverse behaviors, including cells prioritizing distant sources, exhibiting multistep navigation, or showing oscillatory motion and confinement between opposing gradients.\nOur research proposes that many of these complex chemotactic behaviors can be explained by considering the precision with which cells sense each chemical gradient. This precision, quantified as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), is non-monotonic with chemoattractant concentrations; cells sense gradients most accurately at intermediate concentrations and less effectively at very low or very high ones.\nOur model treats cells as active random walkers that possess independent receptors for different chemoattractants. They independently estimate the direction of each local gradient, and these individual estimates are then integrated through a vector sum to determine the overall movement direction. Crucially, cells effectively weight their movement bias towards the gradient they sense more accurately (i.e., the one with a higher SNR). This simple principle can explain a wide range of observed phenomena without needing to invoke more complex mechanisms like memory or receptor desensitization.\nKey Findings Explained by Gradient Sensing Accuracy: # Diverse Spatial Patterns and Confinement: The model predicts that depending on the decay length (λ) of the gradients, cells can exhibit different behaviors.\nFor small λ, SNR peaks are close to the sources, leading cells to migrate toward the nearest source. For larger λ, SNR peaks shift and can cross, causing cells to oscillate or become confined to a region between the sources, referred to as an \u0026ldquo;equipotential region\u0026rdquo; where chemotactic responses balance out. An intermediate λ* results in SNR peaks overlapping centrally, leading to no directional bias and broader cell dispersion. Hierarchical Chemotactic Response and Multistep Navigation: This model explains why cells might prioritize certain \u0026ldquo;end-target\u0026rdquo; chemoattractants (like fMLP) over \u0026ldquo;intermediate\u0026rdquo; ones (like IL-8 or LTB4). This hierarchy emerges from differences in cellular sensitivity to each chemoattractant, such as varying receptor numbers. If a cell has more receptors for one chemoattractant, it creates an asymmetric chemotactic response map, where larger regions favor recruitment towards that more sensitively sensed source. This naturally leads to multistep navigation, where a cell might initially move toward a weaker source before redirecting its trajectory to the preferred, more accurately sensed source. Impact of Source Strength (S0): Variations in the concentration magnitude at the source can alter the spatial distribution of cells, changing from elongated along the source axis to increased dispersion perpendicular to it for large S0 values.\nIn essence, our research highlights that the fundamental accuracy of a cell\u0026rsquo;s gradient sensing is a primary driver of how it navigates and organizes itself in complex, multi-signal environments. The model provides testable hypotheses for future experiments by predicting how changes in chemoattractant concentration, source distance, or receptor numbers could alter cell migration and distribution. This principle could be exploited to strategically organize cell distributions, for example, to concentrate immune defenses in specific areas.\nThink of it like a navigator trying to find their way using multiple, potentially conflicting maps, each with varying levels of detail and accuracy. Instead of blindly following any single map, the navigator intuitively trusts the maps that provide the clearest, most reliable information, even if it means taking a longer or seemingly indirect path to their destination.\nPerez Ipiña, E., \u0026amp; Camley, B.

A central goal of my research is to understand how these feedbacks between cell motility and the environment generate new migration strategies in both single cells and collectives.\nFootprints and migration strategies # Through theoretical modeling and analysis of experiments, I have shown that the impact of footprints depends strongly on geometry. On linear tracks, cells often confine themselves to oscillatory motion, while on two-dimensional substrates they display more exploratory dynamics. Small changes in deposition or sensing of footprints can switch cells between confined, oscillatory, and persistent migration modes (PNAS 2024). These results reveal how even identical cells can adopt fundamentally different strategies simply by varying their interaction with footprints and the substrate.\nCollective effects and guidance efficiency # Footprints also serve as local guidance cues for other cells, enabling leader–follower coordination during collective migration. I study how footprint persistence, density, and degradation shape the efficiency of such guidance, and under which conditions footprints enhance cooperative migration or instead generate crowding and jamming effects. More broadly, I am developing models to assess how footprints affect navigation efficiency, by comparing target search times with and without footprint cues in noisy or degrading environments.\nDetecting the signatures of footprint interactions # Because footprints are often invisible, their role must be inferred from cell trajectories. I identify their signatures through statistical properties such as revisits, velocity correlations, and aging in mean squared displacement. By fitting motility models with Bayesian inference, I extract quantitative parameters like confinement strength and memory timescales. This approach provides a way to reveal and measure footprint interactions even when they cannot be directly observed.\nPerez Ipiña, E., d\u0026rsquo;Alessandro, J., Ladoux, B., Camley, B. A.

My research focuses on what happens when bacteria, like E. coli and Salmonella, move near surfaces such as host tissues—the critical step for starting an infection.\nIs infection just random, or do bacteria really chase host cells? What about chemotaxis? # Bacteria are well known for chemotaxis—following chemical signals to move towards food or targets. In bulk liquid, this strategy works well. But near surfaces, it gets complicated. At the surface, bacteria like E. coli don’t always move straight towards host cells. Their movement becomes circular due to physical effects, and classic chemotaxis doesn’t function in the same way.\nWhat is really interesting—and a main focus of my research—is that E. coli and other bacteria show a special kind of movement when close to surfaces: the stop and go dynamics. They swim for a while, then stop and briefly adhere to the surface before starting again. Our results suggest that the bacteria regulate how often they stop, and that there is an optimal stopping frequency which maximizes how fast they explore the surface (their surface diffusivity). This “stop and go” strategy is not random: it seems to help bacteria scan the surface more efficiently and could be a way to recover some ability to bias their search towards host cells, even when classical chemotaxis is suppressed.\nWhy does this matter? # Understanding this stop and go motion is important because it reveals a possible mechanism bacteria use to increase their chances of successfully finding and infecting host cells. It also explains why infection in these conditions often appears random, but is actually driven by clever search strategies evolved by the bacteria. These dynamics are a big piece of the puzzle for knowing when and how infection starts.\nWhat does this tell us about microorganism motility and the environment? # My broader research tries to connect motility of microorganisms with the physical and chemical environment. Chemotaxis is only one aspect—physical structures, surfaces, and the ability to stop and stick also play a huge role. I am interested in how all these mechanisms combine in real infection scenarios, and how bacteria can adapt their strategies depending on where they are.\nKey questions I am working on include:\nHow do bacteria optimize their surface movement and search strategies? What is the real impact of stop-and-go dynamics for infection and for chemotaxis? Can understanding these strategies help us find new ways to fight bacterial infections? I believe the way bacteria move and interact with their environment is a rich and fascinating topic, with important consequences for health and disease. My goal is to keep uncovering how these small organisms use clever movement strategies to survive and infect.\nOtte, S.Ɨ, Perez Ipiña, E. Ɨ, Pontier-Bres, R., Czerucka, D., \u0026amp; Peruani, F.

These behaviors are governed by physical mechanisms that operate both at the level of single cells and within multicellular groups. My research is focused on elucidating how cells, individually and collectively, acquire sensory information and translate this into directed movement, particularly in the presence of stochastic fluctuations.\nGradient Sensing by Single Cells: Quantitative Limits and Biological Variability # The initial step in gradient sensing involves ligand molecules binding to cell-surface receptors. The accuracy with which individual cells can estimate external concentrations is limited by several sources of noise:\nLigand-receptor binding fluctuations: Diffusive arrival and stochastic binding/unbinding of molecules introduce temporal noise into receptor occupancy. Cell-to-cell variability (CCV): Genetically identical cells can display substantial heterogeneity in molecular and functional properties, often exceeding ligand-receptor noise in magnitude. During my doctoral research, I developed mathematical frameworks to quantify the precision of concentration measurements by cells, accounting for relevant time scales of biological decision-making. Building on the foundational work of Berg and Purcell, these models provide analytic expressions for the autocorrelation of molecular input signals, valid across all time regimes.\nMain results include:\nShort-time accuracy: Corrections to standard concentration estimation can allow the error to decrease more rapidly for short integration times. This fast convergence is relevant for transient processes such as chemotaxis and binding dynamics in gene regulation. Applications: The framework explains observed phenomena, such as the precision of Bicoid gradient sensing in Drosophila embryos and changes in noise properties of enzymatic activity, by connecting measurement accuracy to transport and reaction kinetics. Collective Gradient Sensing: Role of Positional Information # Groups of cells frequently exhibit enhanced gradient detection compared to isolated cells. In our work, we consider how the accuracy of collective sensing depends on the ability of individual cells to localize themselves within the cluster—referred to as positional information.\nApplying a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) approach, we found:\nImpact of uncertainty: Inaccuracies in positional information reduce the overall precision of gradient estimation, especially in steep gradients where spatial mislocalization results in significant concentration error. Edge contribution: Cells at the edge of a cluster contribute disproportionately to collective sensing; prioritizing positional information for edge cells is the most efficient allocation if information acquisition is limited. Scaling with group size: Larger clusters are less affected by positional uncertainty, as individual measurement errors are averaged out. Alternative Mechanisms: Tug-of-War Model # Cells may also coordinate movement without explicit positional knowledge. Based on observations in neural crest and lymphocyte clusters, we compared the MLE framework to a tug-of-war (ToW) model:\nCells polarize and exert force away from immediate neighbors via contact inhibition of locomotion, with polarization restricted to edge cells. In the presence of a gradient, edge cells at the front polarize more strongly, resulting in net directional migration. Comparison of the two models suggests:\nSmaller clusters or steep gradients: The ToW mechanism can yield more accurate orientation than strategies dependent on positional information, particularly when most cells are at the cluster edge. Larger clusters or shallow gradients: The MLE approach becomes optimal as the integration of multiple measurements compensates for positional uncertainty. We constructed phase diagrams delineating the conditions under which each strategy achieves superior accuracy, suggesting that cell clusters may employ distinct mechanisms in different contexts.\nPerez Ipiña, E., \u0026amp; Camley, B.

Environmental factors—including mechanical confinement, substrate composition, and chemical gradients—not only influence single-cell motility but also coordinate complex collective behaviors during development, tissue repair, and disease progression. Understanding how environmental conditions modulate cell migration provides key insights into diverse biological processes such as embryogenesis, immune surveillance, and cancer metastasis.\nEukaryotic Cell Migration in Confined Channels # Using microfluidic channels to model cancer cell invasion, our research shows that physical confinement strongly influences both collective migration and cell dissociation—or \u0026ldquo;rupture.\u0026rdquo; Within these constrained environments, cells detach from invasive strands, a process central to metastatic dissemination. Most rupture events involve single cells breaking away, though larger multicellular clusters (up to ~20 cells) can also detach in wider channels.\nDetachment propensity is not uniform among all cells. Highly motile \u0026ldquo;leader cells,\u0026rdquo; found at the migrating front, are especially prone to dissociation and largely account for the predominance of single-cell ruptures. These leader cells typically exhibit greater self-propulsion and reduced contact with surrounding neighbors, contributing to their likelihood of breaking off.\nAdhesive interactions and chemotactic signaling play key roles in regulating rupture dynamics. Cell–wall adhesion is essential for both invasion into narrow channels and the occurrence of ruptures, but excessive adhesion can inhibit detachment. Stronger cell–cell adhesion generally leads to fewer but larger rupture events. Notably, mathematical modeling indicates that effective cell–cell adhesion may decrease dynamically in narrow confinements, potentially explaining why rupture rates remain similar across different channel widths. Enhanced chemotactic gradients synchronize cell movement, resulting in larger and more rapid ruptures.\nAt the molecular level, confinement-induced dissociation is driven by activation of the RhoA/ROCK/Myosin IIA pathway and changes in microtubule dynamics. RhoA activation, mediated by GEF-H1, Ect2, and RacGAP1, promotes myosin II accumulation at junctions, generating contractile forces that disrupt cell–cell adhesions.\nImportantly, while unjamming (fluidization) of the tissue is a prerequisite for cell dissociation, it alone does not suffice to trigger rupture. Tissues may attain a fluid-like state without necessarily undergoing dissociation, indicating that factors beyond general tissue fluidity are necessary for rupture to occur.\nIn summary, cell migration and dissociation within confined environments reflect a complex interplay between physical constraints, cellular properties, and molecular signaling pathways—mechanisms with direct relevance to our understanding of cancer metastasis and related collective behaviors.\nWang, W., Law, R.
